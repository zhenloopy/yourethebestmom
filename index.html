                    <p class="explanation">Happy Mother's Day! I was planning on making you a card, but I know drawing isn't my strong suit, so I decided to make you a website to show my appreciation and love for you! It might seem a little barren now, but my hope is that as we hang out this summer, we can fill it up with some memories! I love spending time with you and I'm thankful for each moment I get to share with you. You are the light in my life and a role model for me every day. Let's fill up this photobook this summer!</p>
